Hi! I’m Isabellah, the creator of *What Even Is Tech* — a blog where I break down tech topics in a simple, fun, and clear way.

I love coding, chess, art, Disney, and all things aesthetically pleasing. My goal is to learn more, build cool projects, and share what I discover with you.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, comment, and connect.
